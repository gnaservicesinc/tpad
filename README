		TPAD
============================================

Tpad was designed to be simple, fast, and 
easy to use.

We have lots of great text editors in the 
world.  


On one end of the spectrum we have
Programs like gvim that are fast,
feature loaded, versatile and 
for users who are experienced
with them they are easy to use.
Not so much for the rest of us. 

The problem: The number of features 
can be overwhelming making documentation 
difficult for newer  / less sophisticated 
users. They also tent to behave in ways that
these users do not expect. They are not intuitive
for such users. 


Then we have programs like the current 
gedit. Lots of features, plug-ins and they behavior 
in an intuitive manor. The problem, they are slow, 
buggy, bloated, and unstable. 


The goal of Tpad. Use GTK to create a text editor that
is intuitive for new users (easy to use) that is fast and stable.

We want all of the core features without the bloat.
